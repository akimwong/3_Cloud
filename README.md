# Cloud

This code will be used to practice with the different AWS tools, avoiding as much as possible the use of the console interface, and using the SDK [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html#) (Python) to obtain the solution architect, machine learning and data analytics certifications.  <br/>
<br/>
The IDE used to write the code is Jupyter Notebooks (in local or using Google Colab).
