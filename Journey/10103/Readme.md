# [IAM POLICY](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/iam-example-policies.html?highlight=policy)

- When you create an IAM user, groups of users or roles, by default, they have NO permissions
- You have to explicitly give the user permission to do anything in that account
- The way that you grant or deny permission is to associate what is called an `IAM policy` to an IAM user
- You can attach a policy to a group and all of the users in that group will have those permissions
