# [IAM POLICY](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/iam-example-policies.html?highlight=policy)

- A policy define the list of actions that can be performed and the resources those actions can affect
- When you create an IAM user, a group of users, or a role, by default, they have NO permissions
- You have to explicitly give permission to do anything
- The way that you grant or deny permission is to associate them with what is called an 'IAM policy'
