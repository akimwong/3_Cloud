# [IAM](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html#user)

- `One user` represents `one person` in your organization
- Users can be grouped
- Users don't have to belong to a group
- One user can belong to multiple groups
- Groups can only contain users, not other groups
