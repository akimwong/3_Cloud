# [IAM ROLE](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/iam.html?highlight=role#IAM.Role)

- Roles have associated permissions that allow or deny specific actions
- These roles can be assumed for `temporary amounts of time` 
- You use roles to temporarily grant access to `AWS resources, users, external identities, applications, and even other AWS services`
- IAM roles are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily, instead of long-term
