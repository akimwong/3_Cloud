## SECURITY TOOLS

In line with the principle to give LEAST PRIVILEGE for all users mentioned in the 'Security Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework' we can use the next tools

1. IAM CREDENTIALS REPORT (at account level)
- Report that list all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

2. IAM ACCESS ADVISOR (at user level)
- Shows the services permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed
- You can use this information to revise your policies and reduce the permission a user can get
