# AWS Platform SetUp

Steps:<br/>
<br/>
1ยบ [Create a new AWS ROOT account (in spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AUWxW14lhk&t=4s) to start the practice.   As new user, in your first steps you will use the "console interface".  You `MUST` define the credit limit alarms described in the video<br/>
2ยบ Create your personal account (to `avoid the use of the ROOT account`) and [generate your Access Key/Secret Access Key (in spanish)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zMCdUndHy0&t=239s)  and set up in your local computer to communicate with AWS in a programatic way<br/>
3ยบ [Access to boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) that contains all the syntaxis and all the commands that can be use to interact with AWS <br/>
